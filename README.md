## Prompt

Consider a decentralised exchange protocol where tradable pairs are given by a graph: a currency `A` can be traded for currency `B` if `A` and `B` are linked by and edge. Knowing the list of tradable pairs, develop an algorithm to find the shortest route between a currency `A` and a currency `B`.

## Question 1

Explore the test cases ("test/Graph.t.sol") and the Graph contract stub ("src/Graph.sol") and describe how they can be used and linked to our use case

## Question 2

Develop the algorithm in the Graph contract
## Run tests
